A callback is any executable code that is passed as an argument to other code, 
which is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time
In simple language, If a reference of a function is passed to another function as an argument to call it, then it will be called as a Callback function.
In C, a callback function is a function that is called through a function pointer
