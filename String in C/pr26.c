/*However, the scanf() function has some limitations: it considers space (whitespace, tabs, etc) as a terminating character, which means that it can only display a single word (even if you type many words). For example:

/* type this program 
#include<stdio.h>
void main(){
char fullName[30];

printf("Type your full name: \n");
scanf("%s", &fullName);

printf("Hello %s", fullName);
}

 Type your full name: John Doe
 Hello John
*/

/*From the example above, you would expect the program to print "John Doe", but it only prints "John".

That's why, when working with strings, we often use the fgets() function to read a line of text. Note that you must include the following arguments: the name of the string variable, sizeof(string_name), and stdin: */

#include<stdio.h>
void main(){
char fullName[30];

printf("Type your full name: \n");
fgets(fullName, sizeof(fullName), stdin);

printf("Hello %s", fullName);
}

// Type your full name: John Doe
// Hello John Doe

/*Use the scanf() function to get a single word as input, and use fgets() for multiple words.*/
