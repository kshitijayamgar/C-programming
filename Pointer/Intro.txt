A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value.

A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is created with the * operator.

The address of the variable you are working with is assigned to the pointer:
example is as follow:-

#include<stdio.h>
void main(){
int myAge = 43;     // An int variable
int* ptr = &myAge;  // A pointer variable, with the name ptr, that stores the address of myAge

// Output the value of myAge (43)
printf("%d\n", myAge);

// Output the memory address of myAge (0x7ffe5367e044) note that address is not same every time
printf("%p\n", &myAge);

// Output the memory address of myAge with the pointer (0x7ffe5367e044)
printf("%p\n", ptr);
